============================================

## Contents

This collection is a subset of the Théâtre classique collection published by Paul Fièvre at http://www.theatre-classique.fr. This is a sample collection containing 89 French plays from the classical age.

* The plays have premiered between 1640 and 1680.
* The collection only contains comedies, tragedies and tragi-comedies
* Most of the plays are in verse, but some are in prose. No mixed plays have been included.
* Some basic metadata about the plays is available as a CSV file ("metadata.csv") 
* Several visualizations of the texts are available, which build either on the plain text (using "stylo") or the network data (using "dramavis")

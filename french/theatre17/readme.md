Théâtre classique: 89 French plays 1640-1680
============================================

## Contents

This collection is a subset of the _Théâtre classique_ collection published by Paul Fièvre at <http://www.theatre-classique.fr>. This is a sample collection containing 100 French plays from the classical age.

* The plays have premiered between 1640 and 1670.
* The collection only contains comedies, tragedies and tragi-comedies
* For better comparability, all plays are in verse. No plays written partially or entirely in prose have been included.
* Some basic metadata about the plays is available as a CSV file ("metadata.csv")
* The collection is meant for studying the differences between dramatic subgenres. Because the proportions of plays changes with each decade, the collection is not suited for an analysis of chronological development. A balanced subset would need to be greated for such a purpose. 

|genres/decades| 1640s texts  | 1650s texts | 1660s texts | total texts  |

## Formats 

* All plays are available as XML-TEI P5 (folder "tei")
* Plays are also available as plain text versions, containing speaker text only (folder "txt")
* Finally, the plays are available in the "zwischenformat", an abstraction of the full text containing data relevant to network analysis of plays (folder "zf")
